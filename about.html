            <p style="font-size: 20px;" >Agricultural productivity is something on which economy highly depends. This is the one of the reasons that disease detection in plants plays an important role in agriculture field, as having disease in plants are quite natural. If proper care is not taken in this area then it causes serious effects on plants and due to which respective product quality, quantity or productivity is affected.</p>
            <p style="font-size: 20px;">Identification of affected plants is one of the first steps in diagnosing a plant disease.
                Accurate estimates of disease incidence, disease severity, and the negative effects of diseases on the
                quality and quantity of agricultural produce are important for field crop, horticulture, plant breeding,
                and for improving fungicide efficacy as well as for basic and applied plant research</p>
            <p style="font-size: 20px;">To let the farmers know about the disease severity and the negative effects of diseases on the quality of agricultural produce we have designed this App/Website called <b>Eco Team</b>to detect the disease of the plant and  some precautions to follow.  </p>
